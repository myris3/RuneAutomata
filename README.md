# RuneAutomata
Automation tools for Old School Runescape

Trying to automate a few use cases, namely:
  Combat training, MVP, screengrabber.py uses some computer vision to get reasonable results in controlled environments.
  Mining training, not implemented, idea is to simply programm a few mouse events, walking ores to and from bank and so on. Should only be a matter of time.
  
 Future work:
  Create a smarter system, use things learned in CompVis and Deep Learning. Maybe detect enemies of a specific type, and reduce latency.
